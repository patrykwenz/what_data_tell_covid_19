# Problem with running script for actual data

`ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19model` script is good for modeling early phases of pandemic. Dataset used in article was
actual up to 24/04/2020. It contains information about daily new cases, deaths, ifr and non-pharmaceutical interventions.
It was enough to estimate effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 pandemic, but today situation has
changed.
